# Procurement Suite

### 🚀 Strategic Sourcing & Inventory Optimization Toolkit

**Keeler Procurement Suite** is a bespoke web-based decision support system designed for Senior Engineering Buyers. It bridges the gap between complex spreadsheets and quick strategic decision-making, providing real-time visualization for "Make vs. Buy" scenarios and inventory optimization.

### 📊 Current Capabilities

#### **1. Make vs. Buy Analyzer**
* **The Problem:** Deciding whether to manufacture a component in-house (High NRE/Setup, Low Unit Cost) or outsource it (Low Setup, Higher Unit Cost).
* **The Solution:**
    * Visualizes the exact **Break-Even Quantity**.
    * Dynamically plots Total Cost curves for both scenarios.
    * Provides instant recommendations (e.g., *"If demand > 818 units, MAKE"*).

#### **2. Inventory Optimizer (EOQ)**
* **The Problem:** Balancing the cost of holding stock against the cost of placing frequent orders.
* **The Solution:**
    * Calculates the **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)** based on annual demand, holding costs, and ordering fees.
    * Visualizes the "Total Cost Curve" to show the sweet spot for cash flow efficiency.
    * Calculates optimal order frequency (Orders Per Year).

### 🔮 Future Enhancements Roadmap

We are actively developing V2.0 to further integrate with Keeler's supply chain workflow. Planned features include:

#### **Phase 1: Global Sourcing Tools**
* **💱 Multi-Currency Toggle:** Real-time switching between GBP (£), USD ($), and CNY (¥) to compare international supplier quotes instantly.
* **🚢 Freight Logic:** A "Landed Cost Calculator" adding Sea vs. Air freight estimates to the unit price for true cost comparison.

#### **Phase 2: Management Reporting**
* **📄 PDF Export Engine:** One-click generation of "Sourcing Approval Reports." Engineers can download a branded PDF with the break-even graph to attach to Purchase Requisitions (PRs).
* **💾 Local Storage:** Save specific scenarios (e.g., *"Slit Lamp Base Housing - Q3"*) to revisit later without re-entering data.

#### **Phase 3: Integration**
* **🔗 ERP Connector:** Potential for API integration to pull live Annual Demand figures directly from the ERP system, eliminating manual data entry.
* **📉 Supplier Scorecards:** Weighted scoring module to compare suppliers not just on price, but on Lead Time, Quality (PPM), and Risk.
